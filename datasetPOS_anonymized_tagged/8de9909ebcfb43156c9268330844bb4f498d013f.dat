have Aaron Rodgers number... I mean they just get to him I know that...

over with that... Now, that they got exposed, maybe they will... The packers to be honest, were fortunate to be where they were...
#POS P P O W R W P O V V W R O V W D N P V A W V A P V R O V W #POS

well against the packers offense... And Crabtree "represent Carter" had a good game...

have their team screwed up because they go with the hype and it doe snot succeed...

against the patriots or broncos, things probably will not turn out like that...

{
Everything went wrong for them in the second half...
#POS N V A P O P D A N W #POS

to think that teams were average, exposed, overrates, and just a bust so that might have played a part in the chiefs success...
#POS P V D N V A W V W B W F R D N P O V V V D N P D N N W #POS

The chiefs might have been overrated this season... They had the best record and that was commendable but as the season went on, you have

#POS F D B N V V P N W #POS

That is why all that hype and all of that is just that and you can't read too much into it... It was going to "revolutionize" the nfl...
#POS O V R X D N F D P O V R O F O V V R A P O W O V V P W V W D N W #POS

That highly overrated, hyped up Chip Kelly offense just got shoved into dust...

On the other hand, you have him being frustrated probably for the cowboys performance and that's understandable...

And it just is shoved off by Jerry Jones and Jason Garrett and everybody is just calm... That is not good...
#POS F O R V V T P B B F B B F N V R A W O V R A W #POS

temper tantrum.... The cowboys just clearly have a lot more problems than Dez being angry... They have BIG ISSUES....

Compared to Megatron though, he wanted to outshine him...
#POS V P B P W O V P V O W #POS

wanted to prove it... And it did not work out that way... He had some moments and some great catches, yards, and tds...
#POS V P V O W F O V R V T D N W O V D N F D A V W N W F N W #POS

He looked like he was upset that he was not getting the ball.... Yall remember that he did all that talking during the week, so I guess he

#POS P B B F R B B V P V P D N F V O V P N O V P V R F V T W #POS

And then all the attention went on Dez Bryant's rants on the sidelines... First to Romo and other players... Then later on,
#POS F R X D N V P B Z N P D N W A P B F A N W R R P W #POS
}
{
So, you can't put it on Romo this week... People questioned their play calling at the end...
#POS R W O V V O P B D N W N V D N V P D N W #POS

{
The cowboys once again found a way to lose... That defense is just atrocious... I mean they gave up like NUM yards...
#POS D N R R V D N P V W D N V R A W O V O V T P K N W #POS

{
They came back in the last minutes and then game over... They ended up winning DAT....

the lions, Megatron put on a show and Matt Stafford and that last play was crazy... And it worked...

{
we are struggling and this guy is a good qb and wanted to may'be set things straight...

That is why it is just not good to crown anybody too quick...

#POS P D A N W R W D N V R R P P N R W B V D N F O V P V O W #POS

#POS B V O V D A W V N F O V V R O V V P W O V A P D O F O V R O W #POS
}
{
They were not out of the box... So all of that hubla needs to go...
#POS O V R P P D N W P D P O B V P V W #POS
}
{
Give them credit for winning... And that was a one of a kind game but come on...
#POS V D N P V W F O V D K P D N N F V P W #POS
}
{
They have work to do.... Everybody wants to crown the colts.... That is the same colts team that scored NUM against the chargers...
#POS O V N P V W N V P V D N W O V D A N N P V K P D B W #POS
}
{
That defense is the same defense that the cowboys went up to NUM pts on... And the offense was not in sync....
#POS D N V D A N P D N V T P K N P W F D N V R P N W #POS
}
{
The Denver broncos are not completely perfect... They have flaws.....
#POS D B B V R R A W O V N W #POS
}
{
However, as he said after the game, you could tell that it affected him because he was not Peyton....
#POS R W P O V P D N W O V V P O V O P O V R B W #POS

It was absolutely great to see Peyton's homecoming!!!!! It was very special.... He handled it all very well...
#POS O V R A P V Z N W O V R A W O V O D R A W #POS
}
{
Now to the most anticipated, hyped game....
#POS R P D R A W A N W #POS
}
{
So, the chiefs defense is great!!!! But, their offense is still questionable...
#POS R W D N N V A W F W D N V R A W #POS
}
{
Not going to jump too far because that was his first game...
#POS R V P V R R P O V D A N W #POS

I have to say that Case Keenum did pretty well for his first start in a hostile environment...
#POS O V P V D N N V R R P D A V P D A N W #POS

Ok, so the Chiefs remain the only unbeaten team in the league... They barely beat the Texans yesterday but they did...
#POS C W P D B V D A A N P D N W O R V D B N F O V W #POS

So, the Steelers beat the ravens... They are now winning which is good....

#POS N W F W D B B V D A N W D N V V F V R V N P V W F Z N W #POS

{
It sucks for us pats fans.. But, you know in all fairness, the pats did not play well... And they are missing severe pieces from their

}
{
I mean it is a rule but I mean do you call it in that moment in the game... The jets got a good call their way....
#POS O V O V D N F O V V O V O P D N P D N W D N V D A N D N W #POS
}
{
That jets and pats game went to overtime and a "irky eeky call" decided the outcome...
#POS D N F B N V P N F D W N N N W V D N W #POS
}
{
And the cowboys were not able to do more themselves... Offensively and defensively, they are banged up... But got the win...
#POS F D N V R A P V R O W R F R W O V V T W F V D N W #POS
}
{
it is the "high tempo run and gun" and without those NUM pieces, it struggles...
#POS O V D W A N V F N W F P D K N W O V W #POS
}
{
Then, the cowboys defense is bad however, they handled the eagles... You know the thing with  this eagles offense is that
#POS R W D N N V A R W O V D N W O V D N P D N N V O #POS
}
{
And has not practiced much... So, the eagles have trouble... Their defense was not good either...
#POS F V R V R W R W D N V N W D N V R A F W #POS

{
Too much too soon.... He played awful then Barkley came in and was not good... But he is third string qb...
#POS R A R R W O V A R B V P F V R A W F O V A N N W #POS
}
{
It is a week to week league because clearly people started crowning Nick Foles...
#POS O V D N P N N P R N V A B B W #POS
}
{
And then the cowboys and eagles game was quite interesting.... Neither team played well... Both missing key pieces...
#POS F R D N F B N V R A W D N V R W O V N N W #POS
}
{
Now, the redskins side of it... I mean they won.... I would not take away too much from it...
#POS R W D B N P O W O V O V W O V R V R R A P O W #POS
}
{
However, their offensive line showed signs of old... Just hope Cutler is not injured real bad....
#POS R W D A N V N P A W R V B V R V R A W #POS
}
{
Jay Cutler went down... And their offense was good against a terrible redskins defense as well...
#POS B B V R W F D N V A P D A B N P R W #POS
}
{
The bears defense is good at takeaways but that's about it... They allowed NUM pts by the redskins...
#POS D N N V A P N F L P O W O V K N P D N W #POS
}
{
So, my takeaway from the bears side is that they are inconsistent and have work to do....
#POS R W D N P D B N V O O V A F V N P V W #POS
}
{
The redskins beat the bears and Jay Cutler went out with an injury....
#POS D N V D N F B B V T P D N W #POS
}
{
The Chargers beat the jags... The NUMers beat the titans.. The bills beat the dolphins... Ok, to elaborate on some games now...
#POS D B V D B W D B V D N W D N V D N W C W P V P D N R W #POS

The falcons beat the Bucs to get to some scores... The panthers beat the rams... The Bengals beat the lions...

Peyton's don't come along very often... Just because qbs and players and teams are hyped up does not mean that they are all that good...

Then, he wanted to try and straighten it out... You don't want to give Peyton any more motivation and inspiration...
#POS R W O V P V F V O T W O V V P V B D A N F N W #POS

{
And then in sports, we have the colts owner Irsay making headlines again from what he said about Peyton...
#POS F R P N W O V D N N B V N R P O O V P B W #POS

We will see how it all unfolds... Things are just bad now... I mean the economy... There has been no real change...

I mean government shutdown... They are trying to expand the time limit to like January or February to give them extra time...

{
And then, I think people's heart dropped... You never give a hall of fame qb chance after chance...
#POS F R W O V S N V W O R V D N P N N N P N W #POS
}
{
Then they came back... And everybody thought that game was won... The pats stadium was half empty...
#POS R O V R W F N V D N V V W D N N V R A W #POS
}
{
I mean that game was CRAZY... The pats had the saints in check that first half... Unfortunately, the injuries played a part in it..

}
{
the saints... I mean simply AMAZING....
#POS D N W O V R A W #POS

Now finally, the time has come for me to talk about the game of the day!!!!! What about that unbelievable come back the pats had against

}
{
And the cowboys played pretty well...
#POS F D N V R R W #POS
}
{
The redskins are really struggling and RG NUM is not the same... People can make excuses but he is not...
#POS D B V R V F B K V R D A W N V V N F O V R J #POS
}
{
And then Sunday Night football, the redskins lost to the cowboys... I mean not surprising....
#POS F R B N N W D B V P D N W O V R A W #POS
}
{
So, some tests coming for these teams...
#POS R W D N V P D N W #POS
}
{
So, then there were two.. Speaking of the chiefs, they won a wild against Oakland... Struggled though... And Oakland is not good...
#POS R W R R V K W V P D N W O V D A P B W V P W F B V R A W #POS
}
{
They still are one  of the top dogs in the afc and between them and the chiefs who are also undefeated, it will be fun to watch...
#POS O R V K P D A N P D B F P O F D N O V R A W O V V N P V W #POS

And that was good that he did... I mean people just was so sure.... They just talk to talk because that's what they do...
#POS F O V A P O V W O V N R V R A W O R V P V P L O O V W #POS
}
{
So, they need work and are missing some pieces... And the offense is not going to blow everybody out.. And Peyton made a point of that...
#POS R W O V N F V V D N W F D N V R V P V N P W F B V D N P O W #POS
}
{
And the Broncos are not a perfect team... Their defense if yall remember gave up all those points to the cowboys last week...
#POS F D B V R D A N W D N P O V V T D D N P D N A N W #POS
}
{
I mean I think that people got too carried away... The thing with bad teams is that when they play top dogs like that, they give their all..
#POS O V O V D N V R V R W D N P A N V O R O V A N P O W O V D D W #POS
}
{
So, Peyton and some people are talking about the broncos and jags game.. The broncos won by two tds...
#POS R W B F D N V V P D B F B N W D N V P K N W #POS
}
{
You just have to wonder how long this system will work.. It sure did die down quick...
#POS O R V P V R A D N V V W O A V V R A W #POS
}
{
the starter.. That is what people are saying... Vick is exciting and I like him, but the style of play is so one dimensional....
#POS D N W O V O N V V W B V A F O V O W F D N P N V R K N W #POS
}
{
So, the eagles beat the bucs with Foles in and Vick out... I mean I think that the bucs are struggling and I don't know about making him
#POS R W D N V D B P B P F B T W O V O V P D B V V F O V V P V O #POS
}
{
So, it is a good start for the Steelers... Hopefully, they can build off of this.. They lost a lot of pieces as well...
#POS R W O V D A N P D B W R W O V V P P O W O V D N P N P R W #POS
}
{
They still can win of course but it was too early to do all of that... But what else is new??
#POS O R V V P N F O V R A P V D P O W F O R V A W #POS
}
{
I am so happy for them... They beat the jets who people were ready to start crowning because they beat a struggling Atlanta falcons team...

Now, some stories from these other games... The Steelers FINALLY got a WIN!!!!!
#POS R W D N P D A N W D B R V D N W #POS
}
{
So, the Seahawks pulled past the titans...
#POS R W D B V A D N W #POS

out as well... The NUMers beat the cardinals... Surprised?? I am not...
#POS T P R W D B V D N W A W O V R W #POS

}
{
injuries... So, the bills have some light... Well, for this game at least...
#POS N W R W D N V D N W C W P D N P A W #POS
}
{
The Bengals beat the bills in overtime... The Bengals defense is good but their offense is showing some inconsistencies... And they have in

{
You can tell that Rodgers the way he confronted the player...
#POS O V V O B D N O V D N W #POS
}
{
The packers are not that impressive so far this season... And then all the talk about the injuries... So that bites for them...
#POS D N V R D A R R D N W F R X D N P D N W P O V P O W #POS

{
And that big contract... And this is what he does... Have these kind of seasons...
#POS F D A N W F O V O O V W V D N P N W #POS

That is why when all that discussion abut him being "elite" came up, I was like man this is crazy...
#POS O V R R X D N P O V W N W V T W O V P N O V A W #POS
}
{
Ok so my takeaway from that game... The ravens lost a lot of pieces and are struggling to put it together... Flacco is not playing well..

#POS R W O R V V W O V D B V D A N N F R R O V P D N W O R V W #POS

{
I mean the saints own that division now... And the falcons defense even last year was just average... Their offense was high octane...
#POS O V D N V P N R W F D B N R A N V R A W D N V A N W #POS

{
I mean the jets played a clean, polished game. The falcons are not the same team they were last year...

Unfortunately for Romo, it was a crucial pick that cost them the game...

Harden is a good player... But I don't know if he is ready to be mentioned top NUM... And Wade has his ups and downs...

I mean I am no Wade fan by any means but you can't deny that they have won on all levels and he showed up when it mattered where as Durant
#POS O V O V D B N P D V F O V V P O V V P D N F O V T R O V R P B #POS

{
Since Harden or Durant has yet to proven anything except they can score and are good players, I would not go and discredit Wade...
#POS P B F B V R P V N P O V N F V A N W O V R V F V B W #POS
}
{
I think that the he is entitled to his own opinion... But to go back and forth, I don' t know about that...

And then we have some nba news... Durant and Wade kind of going back and forth...

}
{
It will take time... But you know Philly does not play... They better figure it out...
#POS O V V N W F O V B V R V W O R V O T W #POS
}
{
So, Andy Reid knows the eagles inside out and just figured their system out...
#POS R W B B V D N P T F R V D N P W #POS
}
{
KC has a great defense... Their offense has pieces... So, we will see.. Give credit where its due... People hating need to chill...

#POS W F B W O P D N W O V R A A N R O V O W C W O V R V D N W #POS
}
{
Now on to the game, I have heard many sides to it... The eagles have some problems... Their offense is tailor made for Vick, DeSean
#POS R P P D N W O V V A N P O W D N V D N W D N V N V P B W B #POS
}
{
So, the entire situation was very well deserved... The fans were nice and the greetings were as well..
#POS R W D A N V R R V W D N V A F D N V R R W #POS
}
{
And then, KC already has three wins when they won only two games last year...
#POS F R W B R V K N R O V R K N A N W #POS
}
{
The chiefs won...And that is good because Andy Reid's return home after the way he left and he got the win...
#POS D N V W F O V A P B Z V N P D N O V F O V D N W #POS
}
{
So, let's jump into it... So, last night's game was fun.... I was wrong because I thought the eagles would win...

And Philly still has a lot to prove... I will say KC defense looks better than Philly's....
#POS F B R V D N P V W O V V B N V A P Z W #POS

I think that Philly will... I mean KC still I just don't see as an explosive offense...
#POS O V O B V W O V B R O R V V P D A N W #POS

The Manning Bowl.. Peyton went on and handled it... And then their exchange at the end, awkward... Business....

I mean just really.... So, it is going to be a long season... So, Yall get ready...LOL...
#POS O V R R W R W O V V P V D A N W R W O V A W C W #POS
}
{
They really need to figure things out... Big Ben was sacked so many times... The offense did nothing, the injuries... And then the defense
#POS O R V P V N P W A B V V R A N W D N V N W D N W F R D N #POS
}
{
But, now back to my Steelers....
#POS F W R R P D B W #POS
}
{
They still didn't look good but they won...
#POS O R V V A F O V W #POS
}
{
I mean some people don't even want to do that...
#POS O V D N V R V P V O W #POS
}
{
I don't think it is anything to jump up and down about but credit the cowboys for winning...
#POS O V V O V N P V T F R P F N D N P V W #POS
}
{
Their defense still needs work... New faces... So, a long way to go by both teams....
#POS D N R V N W A N W R W D A N P V P D N W #POS
}
{
But, the giants were still right there, and it took NUM turnovers to win.... So, I just don't know... Romo looked better...
#POS F W D B V R R R W F O V K N P V W R W O R V V W B V R W #POS
}
{
broke the curse of losing to the giants in their playhouse....
#POS V D N P V P D N P D N W #POS
}
{
So, mixed reactions... I mean NUM turnovers is never good and the giants made so many mistakes... The cowboys did win and
#POS R W A N W O V K N V R A F D B V R A N W D N V V F #POS
}
{
And then the BIG GAME, the giants and cowboys....
#POS F R D B N W D B F N W #POS
}
{
He can run but he also was slinging it...
#POS O V V F O R V V O W #POS
}
{
But in the season opener, he was good... Teams now, I think are going to have to work a lot harder on how they game plan for him...
#POS F P D N N W O V A W N R W O V V V P V P V D N A P R O N N P O W #POS
}
{
Anquan Boldin in his debut was really good... And Colin was impressive... I admit I was not sure about this...
#POS B B P D N V R A W F B V A W O V O V R A P O W #POS
}
{
The packers d still is struggling but the NUMers d struggled too...
#POS D B B R V V F D B B V R W #POS

St. Louis beat Arizona and then the packers and san Fran game was good... All the talk about Clay Matthews hit on Kaepernick....
#POS B B V B F R D B F B B N V A W X D N P B B V P B W #POS
}

I just am going through all the teams... Some not interesting I know..
#POS O R V V P D D N W D R A O V W #POS

{
Indy beat Oakland, KC beat Jacksonville in Andy Reid's debut...
#POS B V B W B V B P B Z N W #POS
}
{
What else is new.... I know right..
#POS O R V A W O V R W #POS
}
{
Detroit beat Minnesota... And the primary stories there are AP And Calvin Johnson.. Suh also is suppose to be disciplined for a hit...
#POS B V B W F D A N X V B F B B W G R V A P V V P D N W #POS
}
{
Cleveland is supposed to be improved but yet still struggled.. They have a ways to still go...
#POS B V A P V A F R R V W O V D N P R V W #POS
}
{
They paid good enough money for him to have had more touches....
#POS O V A A N P O P V V A N W #POS
}
{
Miami beat Cleveland even though Mike Wallace was upset over the fact that he didn't have a lot of touches.. But he handled it well...
#POS B V B R P B B V A P D N P O V V D N P N W F O V O R J #POS
}
{
Seattle beat Carolina barely... I mean Carolina is still in the same place that they were last year... And Seattle needs improvement...
#POS B V B R W O V B V R P D A N P O V A N W F B V N W #POS
}
{
Now, the Steelers on the other hand were just a HOT MESS.... That is not the Steelers that we know and love....
#POS R W D B P D A N V R D A N W O V R D B P O V F V W #POS
}
{
And this was EJ Manuel's debut and not bad... The bills r rebuilding and their d held Tom in check...
#POS F O V B Z N F R A W D N V V F D N V B P N W #POS
}
{
The pats barely beat the bills... In this new look team, it is going to take some time for the pats to get it together....
#POS D N R V D N W P D A N N W O V V P V D N P D N P V O R W #POS
}
{
So, the saints won that game....
#POS R W D N V D N W #POS
}
{
The falcons just didn't look the same...
#POS D N R V V D A W #POS
}
{
I must admit I had my doubts but in week NUM, they looked better.... And they made stops when important...
#POS O V V O V D N F P N K W O V A W F O V V R A W #POS
}
{
The falcons and saints game was good... That saints d which was horrible last year, looks better under Rob Ryan....
#POS D B F B N V A W D N G D V A A N W V R P B B W #POS
}
{
The jets barely beat the bucs... In Geno Smith much hyped debut...
#POS D N R V D B W P B B A A N W #POS

In this new offense, it was a good game by both teams...
#POS P D A N W O V D A N P D N W #POS
