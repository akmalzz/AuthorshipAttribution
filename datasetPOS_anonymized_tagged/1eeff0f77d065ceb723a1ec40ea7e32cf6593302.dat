precious moments I’ve collected in my pockets in filling in the

the soft coo of your voice grazing its fingers over my eardrums,

I patiently await the warmth of your breath whispered,

What could be cherished more than the acceptance one seeks?

To be accepted as flawed as I am could only be a blessing

A book that I’ve read many times before, but without an ending

A reminder of a sullen past to which I can only think of

It’s not just a transition in nature but one of thought

Like an attempt to stir some crazed complication and emotion

A response to satisfy all those agonizing moments spent on reflection

Perhaps just an answer to a feeling so deaf to reason

Something profoundly larger than myself and those who occupy the dwelling beside me

Or the hope that the night would bring a numbing glow of realization

Maybe the realization that one can be without love, without pain

Many nights were spent standing in wait for an epiphany of sorts
#POS A N V V V P V P D N P N #POS

As if the world drowns to the weather of a dead season
