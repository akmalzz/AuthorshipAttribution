#POS I D N P N V V W F N V V D N W #POS

#POS I F R D N V V A P D W C W O V V W O V V O W #POS

#POS I O V A W X V D N W D K N V A P N W R R V O V V W #POS
}
{
REF Of course. People do not live logically. And it completely baffles me as to why.
#POS I P N W N V R V R W F O R V O R P R W #POS
}
{
REF I suppose that the human tendency to put value and worth upon everything have changed how even out own bodies are seen.
#POS I O V P D A N P V N F V P N V V R R A N N V V W #POS
}

REF Yes. Not something of really choose to look at, really.

#POS I C W C W O V R W #POS

#POS I R W C W #POS
}
{
REF REF If you expected compassion, you were obviously very wrong.
#POS I I P O V N W O V R R A W #POS

#POS I O V R A W #POS

#POS I I O V W D A N V K N W V O V O V P O W #POS
}

REF Yes, it's a job that takes a lot of work.
#POS I C W L D N P V D N P N W #POS
}
{
That was very unusual.
#POS O V R A W #POS
}
{
REF Ah, well that's not something I had to adjust to. I always did my own cleaning.
#POS I C W C L R N O V P V P W O R V D A N W #POS

#POS I C W O R A V P O W #POS

#POS I C W B V V R W P L R V L V D N P A N W L R V W #POS
}
{

#POS I L V D A N W N P V P P N O V V N R W O R V P V O P O W #POS

#POS I O V V P O V P V W O V D N W F O V R W O V V O V V P V R R W #POS

#POS I L R D A A W O V V P V V R R W F W O V V C W #POS

#POS I L R A P D N W P O V V A P O V R V P D N W P N W #POS

#POS I L R A P O W L R R A P D S N W F L R A O L A P V R W #POS

#POS I L N W L D L R V W R R A N W F N W #POS

REF Mhm... I am slightly concerned though. They're not exactly the docile type.
#POS I C W O V R A P W L R R D A N W #POS

#POS I L V V A W R W R V P O W V A W C W R L V V D N N R W #POS
