Single cams often bigger budget. But higher expenses can often mean shorter leash for network tolerance... TAG

Another way you can tell is that multi cam often have live studio audience, laugh track. TAG
#POS D N O V V V D N N R V A N N W V N W H #POS

Whereas multi cams have more of a predictable rhythm, though not to say they have to be formulaic. TAG

I believe a single cam can utilizes a greater range of camera angles and camera movement. TAG
#POS O V D A N V V D A N P N N F N N W H #POS

Single cam usually has a greater range of locations. Not as static, with set sets like multi cams. TAG

Yes, read scripts! Was jsut going to say great way to get a feel for single cam scripts is to read a whole bunch of them! TAG

I think Multi cam tends to play to the joke, it's more setup/punchline. TAG
#POS O V N N V P V P D N W L A N W H #POS

I think single cam generally gives more freedom for different forms of jokes and can use editing to help land a joke. TAG

The exchange of devotion and their connection while they were on the boat dumping the body was so creepy yet compelling. TAG
#POS D N P N F D N P O V P D N V D N V R A R V W H #POS

REF It's fascinating to get a look into what could have led these characters to where they were in the film. TAG
#POS I L A P V D N P O V V V D N P R O V P D N W H #POS
}
{
Once she kills Summers &amp; decides for them not to call cops, stakes get real high. Stain on carpet. Police show up. TAG
#POS R O V B F V P O R P V N W N V A N W N P N W B V T W H #POS

Thought there were strong mounting obstacles/stakes. TAG
#POS V X V A V N W H #POS

REF Agree! TAG
#POS I V W H #POS
}
{
Also felt a kind of shifting empathy. One minute I was like you're manipulative Norma, and then the next I felt bad for her. TAG
#POS R V D N P V N W K N O V P L A B W F R D A O V A P O W H #POS
}
{
REF I guess because there's a lot going on within both of these characters. TAG
#POS I O V P L D N V T P O P D N W H #POS
}
{
There are some really powerful exchanges and psychological/emotional beats. TAG
#POS X V D R A N F A N W H #POS
}
{
REF Yes! We know there's something up with him, but aren't given specifics. Creates intrigue. TAG
#POS I C W O V L N T P O W F V V N W V N W H #POS
}
{
I thought the tone was gripping and consistent. Right from the beginning there's some intrigue &amp; confusion as to what's what. TAG
#POS O V D N V V F A W R P D N L D N F N P P L O W H #POS
}
{
It subtly sets up some future threads like with Summer, the mysterious notebook Norman finds, and what's going on in the town. TAG
#POS O R V T D A N P P B W D A N B V W F L V P P D N W H #POS

#POS I L R R A W V R V D A N P V P O V R W W H #POS
}
{
REF Yes! Meaty role. She got an Emmy nod for it. TAG
#POS I C W A N W O V D B N P O W H #POS
}
{
REF I guess maybe because it was so stylized in places and very heavy on visual cues? TAG
#POS I O V R P O V R A P N F R A P A N W H #POS
}
{
REF Yeah, it took a little getting used to. haha TAG
#POS I C W O V D A V V P W C H #POS
