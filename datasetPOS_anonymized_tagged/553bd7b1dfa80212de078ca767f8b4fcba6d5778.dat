which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.

So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places,

And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak,

every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.

Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.

Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets.

For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;

and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.

until he had cast them out of his sight.

Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their GOD, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.

And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments,

and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.

but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their GOD.

For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.

Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.

this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning-light, some mischief will come upon us:

Then they said one to another, We do not well:

And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver,

and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.

Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents,

and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.

and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites,
#POS F O V K P D W B W D N P B V V P O D N P D B W #POS

{
For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host:

behold, there was no man there.

if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.

Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians:

If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also.

And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?

Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.

Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said,

{
Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of GOD, and said,

Thus saith re LORD, To-morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel,

Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD;

Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?
#POS V W D N V P D B W O V O V P D B D R W #POS

And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said,

{
look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?

but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head?

But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him:

And he said, GOD do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.

and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.

{
And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes;
#POS F O V P V W R D N V D N P D N W P O V D N W #POS

{
So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.

Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.

And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me,

{
And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barn-floor, or out of the wine-press?
#POS F O V W P D B V R V D W R V O V D W P P D N W F P P D N W #POS

And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.

and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.

And there was a great famine in Sanaria: and behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver,

{
And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.

{
So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.

And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master.

{
Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.

And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?

{
And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
#POS F D B V D N W F O V W F V W O V P D N P B W #POS

{
And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.

{
follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.
#POS V O W F O V V O P D N V O V W F O V O P B W #POS

{
And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city:
#POS F B V P O W O V R D N W O V O D N W #POS
}
{
And he smote them with blindness, according to the word of Elisha.
#POS F O V O P N W V P D N P B W #POS

{
And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness.
#POS F R O V T P O W B V P D B W F V W V D N W O V D W P N W #POS
}
{
and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
#POS F V W D N V A P N F N P B N P B W #POS
}
{
And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw:
#POS F B V W F V W B W O V D W V D N W P O V V W F D B V D N P D A N W F O V W #POS

{
And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.
#POS F O V W N R W P O O V P O V A P O O V P O W #POS
}
{
And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! How shall we do?
#POS F D N V P O W R W D N W R V O V W #POS
}
{
And when the servant of the man of GOD was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots.
#POS F R D N P D N P B V V A W F V R W V W D N V D N O P N F N W #POS

{
Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compasses the city about.
#POS R V O R N W F N W F D A N W F O V P N W F V D N P W #POS
}
{
And he said, Go, and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
#POS F O V W V W F N R O V W P O V V F V O W F O V V O W V W V W O V P B W #POS

{
but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakeat in thy bed-chamber.
#POS F B W D N P V P B W V D N P B D N P O V P D N W #POS
}
{
And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king:
#POS F K P D N V W N W D N W B B W #POS

{
and he called his servants, and said into them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?
#POS F O V D N W F V P O W V O R C O D P O V P D N P B W #POS
}
{
Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing;
#POS R D N P D N P B V A A P D N W #POS
}
{
And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of GOD told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.
#POS F D N P B V P D N D D N P B V O F V O P W F V O R W R R F R W #POS
}
{
And the man of GOD sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.
#POS F D N P B V P D N P B W V W V P O V R A D N W P R D B V V T W #POS
}
{
Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
#POS R D N P B V P B W F V N P D N W V W P A F A D N V V D N W #POS
}
{
Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.
#POS R V O W V O T P D W F O V T D N W F V O W #POS
}
{
And the man of GOD said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.

But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
#POS F P K V V D N W D N V P D N W F O V W F V W R W N W P O V A W #POS

{
So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.
#POS P O V P O W F R O V P B W O V T N W #POS

{
And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.
#POS F K V W V N W O V D W F V P D N W F O V W O V V W #POS

{
And he answered, Go ye.
#POS F O V W V O W #POS

{
Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell.
#POS V O V W O V D W P B W F V R D N N W F V O V O D N R W R O V V W #POS

{
And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.
#POS F D N P D N V P B W V R W D N R O V P D V R B P O W #POS

{
The leprosy thereforof Naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.

{
and to receive garments, and olive-yards, and vine-yards, and sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and maid-servants?
#POS F P V N W F A W F N W F N W F N W F N W F N W #POS
}
{
And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money,
#POS F O V P O W V R O V P D W R D N V R P D N P V D W V O D N P V N W #POS

{
But he went in, and stood before his master: and Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.
#POS F O V P W F V P D N W F B V P O W R V O W B W F O V W D N V D N W #POS
}
{
And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.
#POS F R O V P D N W O V O P D N W F V O P D N W F O V D N V W F O V W #POS
}
{
and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.
#POS F V O P K P D N W F O V O P O W #POS
}
{
And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments,
#POS F B V W V N W V K N W F O V O W F V K N P N P K N W P K N P N W #POS
}
{
give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.
#POS V O W O V D W D N P N W F K N P N W #POS

{
Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets:
#POS V W R R R V V P O P N B K A N P D N P D N W #POS

{
And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying,
#POS F O V W X V R W D N V V O W V W #POS

{
Is all well?
#POS V D R W #POS

{
So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said,
#POS P B V P B W F R B V O V P O W O V T P D N P V O W F V W #POS
}
{
in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.
#POS P R V P D N P D O V W F P D B B W O V V P O W F V R P O W #POS

{
But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of GOD, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian,
#POS F B W D N P B D N P B W V W V W D N V V B D A W #POS
}
{
And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
#POS F O V P O W V P N W P O V P O D A N W #POS

{
and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.

{
In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand,
#POS P D N D B V D N W O R D N V P D N P B P V R W F O V P D N W #POS

{
for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering not sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.

{
And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth?
#POS F B V W V R R R W O V D W V V P D N K N W N P N W #POS

{
But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.
#POS F O V W P D B B W P O O V W O V V N W F O V O P V O W F O V W #POS

{
Behold, now I know that there is no GOD in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.

And he returned to the man of GOD, he and all his company, and came and stood before him: and he said,
#POS F O V P D N P B W O F D D N W F V F V P O W F O V W #POS
}
{
and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
#POS F D N V R P P D N P D A N W F O V A W #POS

{
Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of GOD:
#POS R V O R W F V O K N P B W V P D N P D N P B W #POS

{
wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
#POS V O R V V O W R A R R W R O V P D W B W F V A W #POS

{
And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing,
#POS F D N V P W F V P O W F V W D N W P D N V V D V D A N W #POS
}
{
So he turned and went away in a rage.
#POS P O V F V R P D N W #POS

{
Are not Abana and Pharper, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?

and call on the name of the LORD his GOD, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.
#POS F V P D N P D B D B W F V D N P D N W F V D N W #POS

But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand,

{
Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.

And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying,

So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
#POS P B V P D N F P D N W F V P D N P D N P B W #POS

Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

And it was so, when Elisha the man of GOD had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying,

{
Wherewith consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

Am I GOD, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy?
#POS V O B W P V F P V A W P D N V V P O P V D N P D N W #POS

{
And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said,

{
behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.

And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee,

And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.

And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel.

And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.

{
And she said unto her mistress, Would GOD my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.

Ad the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid;

because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.

Now Naaman captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable,

So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.

Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.

And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought the man of GOD bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley,

Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.

And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.

and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.

Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him:

and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
#POS F O V O P D N W F D N P D N V A W #POS

And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands:

He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD.

And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.

Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.

And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing.

{
And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.

and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.

Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not;
#POS R O V P B W V T D N W F V D N P A N W F V D N W P O V D N W V O R W #POS

Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?
#POS R O V W V O V D N P D N W V O R V W V R V O W #POS

{
And the man of GOD said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.

And when she came to the man of GOD to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away.

And she answered, It is well.

Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with the child?

And it came to pass, when the man of GOD saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:

So she went and came unto the man of GOD to mount Carmel.

Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.

And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? It is neither new-moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.

And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.

And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.

Nay, my lord, thou man of GOD, do not lie unto thine handmaid.

And she said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.

wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.

And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
#POS F O V P V D N W V D B W F R O V V O W O V P O W #POS

{
And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.

{
and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
#POS F O V V W R O V P O W P O V V T R W #POS

Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick:

that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
#POS O R A P O V P W O V P R P V N W #POS

{
And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was,
#POS F O V P D N W O B V P B W R V D A N W F O V O P V N W F P O V W #POS
}
{
Then she came and told the man of GOD. and he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.
#POS R O V F V D N P B W F O V W V W V D N W F V D N W F V O F D N P D N W #POS

There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.

And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her,
#POS F O V P V W R D N V A W P O V P D N W V O R D N W F O V P O W #POS
}
{
So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.
#POS P O V P O W F V D N P O F P D N W O V D N P O W F O V T W #POS

{
and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
#POS F O V V N P O V A W #POS

And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels,
#POS F R D N V P W O V V D N P D F P D N W F V V T P D D N W #POS

{
Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.

{
Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house save a pot of oil.

And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said,

{
and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bond-men.
#POS F O V O D N V V D B W F D N V V P V P O D K N P V B W #POS

Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead;
#POS R R V D A N P D N P D N P D N P B W V W D N D N V A W #POS
}
{
and there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.
#POS F R V A N P B W F O V P O W F V P D A N W #POS

{
Then he took his eldest son, that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall:
#POS R O V D A N W O V V V P D N W F V O P D A P D N W #POS
}
{
to break through even unto the king of Edom; but they could not.
#POS P V P R P D N P B W F O V R W #POS

{
And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords,
#POS F R D N P B V P D N V R A P O W O V P O K K N P V N W #POS
}
{
howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.
#POS C D N V P O W F V O W #POS

{
and they stopped all the well of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof;
#POS F O V X D N P N W F V X D A N W R P B V O D N R W #POS

{
And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it;
#POS F O V T D N W F P D A N P N N D N D N W F V O W #POS

{
but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.
#POS F O V R V D B W R P D N W #POS

{
And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them:
#POS F R O V P D N P B W D B B T F V D B W P P O V P O W #POS

{
And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
#POS F O V W O V N W D N V R V W F O V V K D W R R W B W P D N W #POS
}
{
And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:
#POS F O V T A P D N W F D N V P D N W F D B V D N P D A N P A P N W #POS
}
{
they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.
#POS O V D O V A P V P N W F A W F V P D N W #POS

{
And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them,
#POS F R X D B V P D N V V T P V P O W #POS
}
{
and the country was filled with water.
#POS F D N V V P N W #POS

{
And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat-offering was offered, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom,
#POS F O V P V P D N W R D N V V W O V W R V N P D N P B W #POS

and mar every good piece of land with stones.

And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water,
#POS F O V V D A N W F D N N W F V V D A N W F V D B P N W #POS

{
And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.

yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.

{
For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain;

And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.

{
But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.

were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.

{
And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely,

{
for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.

{
get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay:

{
And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee?
#POS F B V P D N P B W O V O P V P D W #POS

{
And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
#POS F B V W D N P D B V P O W P D N P B F B F D N P B V R P O W #POS
}
{
And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat which poured water on the hands of Elijah.
#POS F K P D N P Z N V F V W R V B D N P B D V N P D N P B W #POS

{
But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him?
#POS F B V W V R R R D N P D B W P O V V P D B P O W #POS

{
And the king of Israel said, Alas, that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
#POS F D N P B V W R W P D B V V D K N R W P V O P D N P B W #POS

{
and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.
#POS F R V D N P D N W F P D N P V O W #POS

{
So the king of Israel went, and the of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven day's journey:
#POS P D N P B V W F D P B W F D N P B W F O V D N P K S N W #POS

{
And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.

{
my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.

wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art,

{
And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me:

{
And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.

But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.

and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.

And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs,
#POS F B B P B V D N W F V P D N P B D K K N W #POS

Nevertheless, he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

{
for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.

{
And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother;

{
and reigned twelve years.
#POS F V K N W #POS

Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
#POS R B D N P B V P V P B P B P D A N P B B P B W #POS

{
And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.

and there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.

And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD.

and said unto him, Go up, thou bald-head; go up, thou bald-head.

And he went up from thence unto Beth-el: and as he was going up the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him,

{
So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.

Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death of barren land.
#POS R V D B W O V V D N W R V R V P R D A N P B N W #POS

And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said,

{
And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.

but the water is naught, and the ground barren.

And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth:

{
And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?

And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.

And he said, ye shall not send.

lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.
#POS R B D N P D B V V O T W F V O P D N W F P D N W #POS

And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men: let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master:

The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
#POS D N P B V V P B W F O V P V O W F V O P D N P O W #POS

{
And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said,

And when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.

And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD GOD of Elijah?

He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;

and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.

and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.

And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire,

nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.

Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.

And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard,

{
And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.

}
{
so shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.

And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him,

{
Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy like be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.

So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.

Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.

And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.

behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.

Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.
#POS V O W O V D W F D N V P V O W #POS

{
And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD,

{
So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.

and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant.

And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore;

Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.

Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said,

{
Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.

So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said,

And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.

But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left.

And there came a man of GOD, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said,

and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.

And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them:

And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.

and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.

And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot:

And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:

therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.

And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.

And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.

So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.

he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.

peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.

And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.

When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of GOD is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:

the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass.

And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.

Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.

For it was said to me by the word of the LORD,

And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:

Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.

Art thou the man of GOD that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.

And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,

And their father said unto them, What way went he? for his sons had seen what way the man of GOD went which came from Judah.

the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.

Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of GOD had done that day in Beth-el:

So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.

For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.

and became as it was before.

according to the sign which the man of GOD had given by the word of the LORD.

The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,

that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.

And it came to pass when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of GOD, which had cried against the altar in Beth-el,

}
{
Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.

And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken;

{
and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, the men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.

{
And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said,
#POS F O V P D N P D N P D B W F V W #POS
}
{
And behold, there came a man of GOD out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
#POS F V W R V D N P B P P B P D N P D B P B W F B V P D N P V N W #POS

{
and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.

{
even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel;
#POS R P D N D O V V P D A N W F V D N P D N P B W #POS

{
So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el the fifteenth day of the eighth month,
#POS P O V P D N D O V V P B D A N P D A N W #POS

{
and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made.
#POS F O V P B D N P D A N D O V V W #POS

and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he made:
#POS F O V P D N W P V O P B W V P D N P O V W #POS

{
And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah,
#POS F B V D N P D A N W P D A N P D N W P P D N P V P B W #POS

{
And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.
#POS F O V D N P A N W F V N P D A P D N W D V R P D N P B W #POS

{
And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.

And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan.

Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem:

If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord,

And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David.

Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.

for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.

Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house;

{
and to the remnant of the people, saying,

Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin,
#POS V P B D N P B W N P B W F P D D N P B F B W #POS

{
But the word of GOD came unto Shemaiah the man of GOD, saying,

{
to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.

an hundred and four score thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel,

And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin,
#POS F R B V V P B W O V D D N P B W P D N P B W #POS

and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.

And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation,

}
{
So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
#POS P B V P D N P B P D N W #POS

{
Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
#POS R N N V N P V O T P D N W P V P B W #POS

Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.

{
But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

So Israel departed unto their tents.

What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David.

So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying,

{
that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
#POS P O V V D V W D D B V P B D B P B D N P B W #POS

{
Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was from the LORD,

{
my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;

So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.

my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke:

My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:

But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him,

and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.

How do ye advise that I may answer this people?

And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said,

now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.

And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:

Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.

even he lifted up his hand against the king.

And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.

{
For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

}
{
and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his GOD, as was the heart of David his father.

{
For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods:

{
And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

But king Solomon loved many strange woman, together with the daughter of Pharaoh,

and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
#POS F R P D D N P D B W F P D N P B W V O V O T P D N W #POS

{
And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty:

And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
#POS F B V N V P P B W F A N W D S N V D N N P D N W #POS

{
And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the vale, for abundance.

whom he bestowed in the cities of chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.

a rate year by year.

{
And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which GOD had put in his heart.
#POS F D D N V P B W P V D N W D B V V P D N W #POS

So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.

{
and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
#POS F A W N W F B W F N W #POS

For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold,

{
none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.

And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.

and there was stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.

{
The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind:
#POS D N V K N W F D N P D N V R P W #POS
}
{
Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.

{
and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
#POS F D N V O P D N P D N P B W #POS

{
And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield:
#POS F O V K K N P V A W K N P B V P K N W #POS

{
And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.

and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.

Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,

So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.

there came no such almug-trees, nor were seen unto this day.

And the king made of the almug-trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers:
#POS F D N V P D N N P D N P D B W F P D S N W N R F N P N W #POS

And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees, and precious stones.
#POS F D N R P B W O V B P B W V P P B A N P N W F A N W #POS

{
there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.

And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones:
#POS F O V D N D N F K N P B W F P N R A N W F A N W #POS

because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.

Howbeit, I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it:

And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,

And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.

and when she was come to Solomon, she communes with him of all that was in her heart.
#POS F R O V V P B W O V P O P D O V P D N W #POS

And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.

#POS F P D N V K N W F D N P D N V V P D N W #POS
}
{
and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, four square, not round.
#POS F R P D N P O V V P D N W K N W R N W #POS
}
{
but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and a half:
#POS F D N R V N P D N P D N W D N F D N W #POS
}
{
And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:
#POS F D N P O P D N F P V D N W #POS
}
{
under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
#POS P D B V A A W P D N P D N W #POS
}
{
And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters:
#POS F D N V K A N W F N P N W F D K N R V B W #POS
}
{
and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.
#POS F P D N F N V A N V P A N W #POS
}
{
And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above:
#POS F P D N P V P D N V N W N W F N W F P D N R V D N P W #POS
}
{
And the work of the brass was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:
#POS F D N P D N V P D N W O V N W F D N V P D N W #POS
}
{
four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
#POS K B V D N P K N W F K P D N R W F K P D N P O W #POS
}
{
And he made ten bases of brass;
#POS F O V K N P N W #POS
}
{
it contained two thousand baths.
#POS O V K K N W #POS
}
{
And it was an hand-breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies:
#POS F O V D N A W F D N R V A P D N P D N W P N P N W #POS
}
{
and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
#POS F K V P D N W F D N V V P P O W F D D N N V A W #POS
}
{
It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south,
#POS O V P K N W K V P D N W F K V P D N W F K V P D B W #POS
}
{
the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.
#POS D B V N P K N W R O V N W #POS
}
{
And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about:
#POS F P D N P O V P X V B V O W K P D N W V D N N P W #POS
}
{
and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
#POS F D N P K N V V O V P W #POS
}
{
And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits:
#POS F O V D A N W K N P D K N P D A W O V V R P W F D N V R B W #POS
}
{
And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
#POS F P D N P D N V B W P V D N P D N V W #POS
}
{
and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.
#POS F O V T D A N W F V D N R B W #POS
}
{
And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin:
#POS F O V T D N P D N P D B W F O V T D A N W F V D N R B W #POS
}
{
and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.
#POS F D N V K K P N N P P D A N W #POS
}
{
And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the net-work:
#POS F D N P D K N V N R P W P P D N D V P D N W #POS
}
{
And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily-work in the porch, four cubits.
#POS F D N P V P D N P D N V P B P D N W K B W #POS
}
{
and so did he for the other chapiter.
#POS F R V O P D A N W #POS
}
{
And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one net-work, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates:
#POS F O V D N W F K N N P P D K N W P V D N P V P D N W P N W #POS
}
{
seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.
#POS K P D K N W F K P D A N W #POS
}
{
And nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;
#POS F N P N W F N P N W P D N D V P D N P D N W #POS
}
{
the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:
#POS D N P D K N V R B W F D N P D A N V R B W #POS
}
{
And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tips of the pillars:
#POS F O V K N P A N W P V P D N P D N W #POS
}
{
For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.
#POS P O V K N P N W P K N A N W F D N P K N V N F P O P W #POS
}
{
and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
#POS F V W F V P V D N P N W F O V P B B W F V D D N W #POS
}
{
He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom,
#POS O V D S N P D N P B W F D N V D N P B W D N P N W F O V V P N W #POS
}
{
And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
#POS F B B V F V B P P B W #POS
}
{
both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.
#POS O P D A N P D N P D B W F P D N P D N W #POS
}
{
And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams,
#POS F D A N N P V P K N P B N W F D N P N N W #POS
}
{
And above were costly stones, after the measure of hewed stones, and cedars.
#POS F P V A N W P D N P B N W F N W #POS
}
{
And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones; stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
#POS F D N V P A N W R A N W N P K N W F N P K N W #POS
}
{
even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.
#POS R P D N P D N W F R P D N P D A N W #POS
}
{
All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without,
#POS X D V P A N W V P D N P B N W V P N W P F P W #POS
}
{
Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.
#POS B V R D N P Z N W O O V V P N W P P D N W #POS
}
{
And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work.
#POS F D N R O V V D N P D N W D V P D P N W #POS
}
{
and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
#POS F O V V P N P K N P D N P D A W #POS
}
{
Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment:
#POS R O V D N P D N R O V V W R D N P N W #POS
}
{
and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.
#POS F D A N F D A N V P O W #POS
}
{
And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them:
#POS F O V D N P N W D N R V R B W F D N R A N W F D N V P O W #POS
}
{
And all the doors and posts were square with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.
#POS F D D N F N V A P D N W F N V P N P K N W #POS
}
{
And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.
#POS F R V N P K N W F N V P N P K N W #POS
}
{
And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams that lay on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row.
#POS F O V V P N P P D N P V P A N W K P D N W #POS
}
{
and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
#POS F D N R A N W P K N P N N W P N N P D N W #POS
}
{
He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits,
#POS O V R D N P D N P B W D N R V D N N W F D N R K N W #POS
}
{
But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
#POS F B V V D A N K N W F O V D D N W #POS
}
{
and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.
#POS F V P X D N P O W P V O K N P N O W #POS
}
{
And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul (which is the eighth month) was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof,
#POS F P D A N W P D N N W O V D A N W V D N V P D D N R W #POS
}
{
In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:
#POS P D A N V D N P D N P D B V W P D N N W #POS
}
{
And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
#POS F O V D A N P K N P B B W F D N P N N W #POS
}
{
And he carved thereon cherubims, and palm-trees, and open flowers; and covered them with gold, fitted upon the carved work.
#POS F O V R B W F N W F V N W F V O P A W V P D A N W #POS
}
{
And the two doors were of fir-tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
#POS F D K N V P N W D K N P D K N V V W F D K N P D A N V V W #POS
}
{
So also made he for the door of the temple, posts of olive-tree, a fourth part of the wall.
#POS P R V O P D N P D B W N P A W D A N P D N W #POS
}
{
and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm-trees.
#POS F V O P A W F V A P D N W F P D N W #POS
}
{
The two doors also were of olive-tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims, and palm-trees, and open flowers,
#POS D K N R V P A W F O V P D N P B W F N W F V N W #POS
}
{
And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive-tree: the lintel and side-posts were a fifth part of the wall.
#POS F P D N P D B O V N P A W D B F N V D A N P D N W #POS
}
{
And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
#POS F D N P D N O V P A W P F P W #POS
}
{
And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims, and palm-trees, and open flowers, within and without.
#POS F O V X D N P D N V P P A N P B W F N W F V N W P F P W #POS
}
{
And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
#POS F O V D N P A W #POS
}
{
and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
#POS F D N V K D P D N P D N W #POS
}
{
so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall;
#POS P P D N P D K V D K N W F D N P D A N V D A N W #POS
}
{
And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims,
#POS F O V D N P D A N W F O V R D N P D N W #POS
}
{
The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
#POS D N P D K N V K N W F R V O P D A N W #POS
}
{
And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.
#POS F D A N V K N W O D B V P K N F K N W #POS
}
{
from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
#POS P D A N P D K N P D A N P D A V K N W #POS
}
{
And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub:
#POS F K B V D K N P D N W F K P D A N P D N W #POS
}
{
And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive-tree, each ten cubits high.
#POS F P D B O V K N P A W D K N N W #POS
}
{
also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
#POS R D A N P V P D B O V P A W #POS
}
{
And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house:
#POS F D A N O V P A W P O V V X D N W #POS
}
{
and he overlaid it with gold.
#POS F O V O P A W #POS
}
{
So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle;
#POS P B V D N P P A N W F O V D N P D N P A P D B W #POS
}
{
and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.
#POS F O V O P A N W F R V D N D V P N W #POS
}
{
And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof:
#POS F D B P D N V K N P N W F K N P N W F K N P D N N W #POS
}
{
And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
#POS F D B O V P D N P W P V R D N P D N P D N W #POS
}
{
And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
#POS F D N P D N P V V P B F V N W D V N W X V D N V W #POS
}
{
And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.
#POS F D N W O V W D B P O W V R R A W #POS
}
{
he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.
#POS O R V O P O P W R P D B W R P D R A N W #POS
}
{
And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar:
#POS F O V K N P D N P D N W O D N F D N P N P N W #POS
}
{
and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
#POS F O V O P D R P B W F V D N P D N P N P N W #POS
}
{
And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling:
#POS F O V D N P D N P P N P N W O D N P D N W F D N P D N W #POS
}
{
So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
#POS P B V D N W F V O W #POS
}
{
And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
#POS F O V V P D N P B W F V R V D N B W #POS
}
{
and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:
#POS F V D D N P V P O W R V O V D N P D W D O V P B D N W #POS
}
{
Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments,
#POS V D N D D N P N W P O V V P D N W F V D N W #POS
}
{
And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
#POS F D N P D B V P B W V W #POS
}
{
And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
#POS F R O V N P D D N W K N N W F O V P D N P N P N W #POS
}
{
So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
#POS P O V D N W F V O W F V D N P N F N P N W #POS
}
{
and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.
#POS F O V T P V N P D N N W F P P D N P D A W #POS
}
{
The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house:
#POS D N P D N N V P D A N P D N W #POS
}
{
so that there was neither hammer nor axe, nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
#POS P O R V D N F N W F D N P N V P D N W P O V P N W #POS
}
{
And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither:
#POS F D N W R O V P N W V V P B V A P O V V R W #POS
}
{
for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
#POS P P P D N P D N O V V V R P W P D N V R V V P D N P D N W #POS
}
{
The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad:
#POS D N N V R R A W F D N V K N A W F D A V K N N W #POS
}
{
both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about.
#POS O P D B F P D B W F O V B V P W #POS
}
{
And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about,
#POS F P D N P D N O V B V P W P D N P D N V P W #POS
}
{
And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
#POS F P D N O V N P A N W #POS
}
{
and ten cubits was the breadth thereof, before the house.
#POS F K B V D N R W P D N W #POS
}
{
And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;
#POS F D N P D N P D N W K N V D N R W V P D N P D N W #POS
}
{
and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.
#POS F D N R K N W F D N R A N W #POS
}
{
And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits,
#POS F D N D N B V P D B W D N R V R B W #POS
}
{
which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
#POS O V D A N W P O V P V D N P D N W #POS
}
{
in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif,
#POS P D A N P Z N P B W P D N B W #POS
}
{
And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,
#POS F O V P V P D K K F N N P D N P B V V P P D N P B W #POS
}
{
And Solomon's builders, and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone-squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.
#POS F Z N W F Z N V C O W F D N W P O V N F N P V D N W #POS
}
{
And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
#POS F D N V W F O V A N W A N W F V N W P V D N P D N W #POS
}
{
three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
#POS K K F K K W D V P D N P A P D N W #POS
}
{
Besides the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work,
#POS P D N P B B D V P D N W #POS
}
{
And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;
#POS F B V B F K K D A N W F N K N P D N W #POS
}
{
And Adoniram was over the levy.
#POS F B V P D N W #POS

{
And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home.
#POS F O V O P B K K D N P N W D N O V P B W F K N P N W #POS
}
{
And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
#POS F B B V D N P P D B W F D B V A K N W #POS
}
{
And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
#POS F D B V B N W P O V O W F R V N P B F B W F O K V D N R W #POS
}
{
thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
#POS R V B P B N P N W #POS
}
{
And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil:
#POS F B V B K K N P N P N P D N W F K N P A N W #POS
}
{
So Hiram gave Solomon cedar-trees and fir-trees according to all his desire.
#POS P B V B N F V V P D D N W #POS
}
{
and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household.
#POS F O V V O W F O V V D N P V N P D N W #POS

and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there,

{
My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea:

{
and I will so all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
#POS F O V P D D N V N P N W F V N P N W #POS

{
And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for:

{
Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
#POS A V D B D N W D V V P B D A N P D A N W #POS

{
And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said,

{
for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.

and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint:

#POS P O V V P O V A O N P D N P D N W P B V R D N P B W #POS

he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.

And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.

Then came there two woman, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.

{
And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.

so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.

{
And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour:

so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.

{
Behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart;
#POS V W O V V V P D N W C W O V V D D A F D N N W #POS

{
nor hast asked the life of thine enemies: but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
#POS F V V D N P D N W F V V P D N P V N W #POS

{
And GOD said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself,
#POS F B V P O W P O V V D N W F V R V P O A N W F V V N P O W #POS
}
{
And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.

}
{
for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
#POS P O V A P V D D R A D N W #POS

Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad:

And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.

and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.

{
And now, O LORD my GOD, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father:
#POS F R W B B D B W O V V D N N R P B D N W #POS

{
and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.

and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee;

{
In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and GOD said, Ask what I shall give thee.

{
a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
#POS D K V V B N P D N W #POS

{
And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place:
#POS F D N V P B P V R W P O V D A A N W #POS
}
{
And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
#POS F B V D B W V P D N P B D N W A O V F V N P A N W #POS
}
{
Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.

{
and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.

and brought her into the city of David until he had made an end of building his own house,

And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter,
#POS F B V N P B N P B W F V Z N W #POS

{
And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
#POS F D N V V P D N P B W #POS

So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died.

{
And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.

therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;

The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father:

Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?

The word that I have heard is good.

And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying,

And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.

And Shimei arose and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.

And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.

{
thy blood shall be upon thine own head.

For it shall be, that on that day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die:

{
Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.

And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,

And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Adiathar.
#POS F D N V B D N P B P D N P D N W F B D N V D N V P D N P B W #POS

So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.

And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him;

And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.

And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here.

Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.

And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and behold, he is by the altar.

{
and Jaob fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

Then tidings came to Jaob: (for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom;)

{
that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD;

{
and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.

And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death:

why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?

And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench:

he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.

And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.

and he died. So Jaob and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
#POS F O V W P B F V D N V P B D N P B W #POS

so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again;

But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:

And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him,

and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men:

{
take thou the Lord's servants and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.

And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom:

{
So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
#POS P B V P V D N P B W F O V R P D N N D O V V O W #POS

Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.

and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them.Â So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.

but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
#POS F D N P B B P D N W P B R P B W #POS

So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri:

We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.
#POS O V D N P B W D V O N P D N P B W D N P D N W B B W #POS

And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said,

{
And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.

why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?
#POS R R V O V O W P D N V R V R V P V R D N W #POS

And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye:

wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?
#POS N R V O A P D N W V O V P D P D S N W F V O V O D N W #POS

{
And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us:
#POS F D D N P B V D N P B W P D N V P P B P O W #POS

{
and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?
#POS F V V D N W F D N W F D Z N P O W P B W #POS

And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away,

and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.

Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:

wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?

And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

for he was a very great man.

And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.

yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?
#POS R V O V D N P O O V V P D A N W O R R V O R P V D A P D N W #POS

For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king:

but my lord the king is as an angel of GOD: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.

And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king;

Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?

nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.
#POS F V D N W P D N D N V P D N O V R P N W #POS

Therefore the king said Shimei, Thou shalt not die: and the king sware unto him.

And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me,

And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;

Behold, another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.

But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?

Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cuahi. And Joab said,

The said Joab to Cushi, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.

And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day:

Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.

I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.

Now Absalom in his life-time had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said,
#POS R B P D N V V F V T P O D N W O V P D N B W P O V W #POS

and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.

And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood,

And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.

{
Then said Joab, I may tarry thus with thee.

for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.

Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life:

Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.

yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying,

{
And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand,

{
And I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.

And Joab said unto the man that told him, And behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground?
#POS F B V P D N P V O W F V W O V O W F R V O R V O R P D N W #POS

And a captain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.

{
and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.

And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the think boughs of a great oak,

For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;

And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.

And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.

And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.

neither if half of is die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us:

But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us;

And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.

And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.

The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.

And honey, and butter,Â and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said,

And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,

So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
#POS O V P P B D N P B W N P B W Z N W #POS

{
And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was man's son whose name was Ithra, an Israelite,
#POS F B V B N P D N R P B W D B V S N L N V B W D B W #POS
}
{
Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
#POS R B V P B W F B V P B W O F D D N P B P O W #POS

{
and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
#POS F V D N P N W F V O W F V W F V V P D N P D N W #POS
}
{
And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city,
#POS F R B V P D N V R V W O V D N W F V W F V O N P D N W P D N W #POS
}
{
by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.
#POS P D N N R V R K P O O V R V P B W #POS

{
Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan:

}
{
Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Abithophel counselled against you.
#POS V W F V R P D N W P O V B V P O W #POS
}
{
And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David,

they be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
#POS O V V P D N P N W F R O V V F V R V O W O V P B W #POS

{
And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them,
#POS F R Z N V P D N P D N W O V W R V B F B W F D N V P O W #POS

{
And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the king was not known.

which had a well in his court; whither they went down.
#POS D V D R P D N W V O V R W #POS

{
Nevertheless, a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahirim,
#POS R W D N V O W F V B W F O V D P O R R W F V P D S N P B W #POS
}
{
and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.
#POS F D N V F V O W F O V F V B B W #POS

{
Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; (for they might not be seen to come into the city;)

lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.

Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over;

{
and thus and thus have I counselled.
#POS F R F R V O V W #POS

{
Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Ahiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel:
#POS R V B P B F P V D N W R F R V B N B F D N P B W #POS
}
{
For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.
#POS P D B V V P V D A N P B W P D N P D B V V A P B W #POS
}
{
And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
#POS F B F D D N P B V W D N P B D B V A P D N P B W #POS
}
{
until there be not one small stone found there.

Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,

{
and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.
#POS F P O F P X D N P V P O R V R V V R A P K W #POS

{
So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground:

{
as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.

{
Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba,
#POS R O V P D B V R V P D W P B R P B W #POS

{
for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.
#POS P D B V O D N V D A N W F O D V P O V A N W #POS

{
And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt:

{
that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
#POS O O V O V V W X V D N P D N P V B W #POS

{
Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first,

{
as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
#POS P D N V P D N P D N W F D N V D N P N W F V R V P D N W #POS

{
For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds,
#POS P W V B W O V D N F D N W P O V A N W F O V V P D N W #POS
}
{
And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.
#POS F B V P B W D N P B V V V R A P D N W #POS
}
{
shall we do after his saying? if not, speak thou.
#POS V O V P D V W P R W V O W #POS

{
And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner:
#POS F R B V V P B W B V P O W V W B V V P D N W #POS
}
{
Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.
#POS R V B W V R V D B R W F V O V C O O V W #POS
}
{
And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
#POS F D V A B R W F D D N P B W #POS

{
And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.
#POS F O V V T X D N P D W D N V O N V P P D V W P X D N V V P N W #POS

{
and I will smite the king only:
#POS F O V V D N R W #POS

{
And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee;
#POS F O V V P O P O V A F A W F V V O A W F D D N P V P O V V W #POS

{
Moreover, Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:
#POS R W B V P B W V O R V T K K N W F O V V F V P B D N W #POS

{
so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
#POS P V D D N P B O P B F P B W #POS
}
{
And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of URL

{
So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.

and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.

{
Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.

should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.

And again, whom should I serve?

But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying,

And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.

If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.

And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king,
#POS F O V P V P K N W O B V P D N W #POS

{
And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
#POS F P D N V B P D B P V P D N P N W P B V D N P D N P B W #POS
}
{
And it was so, that when man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.

{
and I would do him justice!
#POS F O V V O N W #POS

Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me,
#POS B V R W C P O V V V P D N W P D N D V D N F P V V P O W #POS
}
{
And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.
#POS F B V P O W V W D N V A F R W F R V D N N P D N P V D W #POS

{
Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
#POS P O N N O W F O V W D N V P K P D N P B W #POS

{
and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said,
#POS F O V R W O R D N P V D N V P D N P N W R B V P O W F V W #POS
}
{
And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:
#POS F B B T A W F V P D N P D N W #POS

{
And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
#POS F O V P V P O W O B V O N F N W F K N P V P O W #POS
}
{
he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
#POS O V P D N W F V O P D N P D N P D N W F D N V B W #POS
}
{
So Jaob cane to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom;
#POS P B N P D N W F V O W F R O V V P B W #POS
}
{
now therefore let me see the king's face; and it there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
#POS R R V O V D S N W F O R V D N P O W V O V O W #POS
}
{
Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still:
#POS B V O V P B W O V V A P O P V V R R W #POS
}
{
And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say,
#POS F B V B W V W O V P D W V W V R W P O V V D P D N W P V W #POS
}
{
Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
#POS R B V W F V P B P D N W F V P O W B V D N V D N P N W #POS
}
{
And Absalom's servant set the field on fire.
#POS F Z N V D N P N W #POS

{
Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire.
#POS R O V P D N W V W Z N V P O W F O V R R W V F V O P N W #POS

{
and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
#POS F R O V R D A N W O V R V W #POS

{
Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him:
#POS R B V P B W P V V O P D N W F O V R V P O W #POS
}
{
So Absalom dwelt two full years in Â Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.
#POS P B V K A N P B W F V R D S N W #POS
}
{
And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
#POS F P B X V V K N W F K N W L N V B W O V D N P D A N W #POS
}
{
he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
#POS O V D N P D N P K K N P D S N W #POS
}
{
And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it;)
#POS F R O V D N W W P O V P D S N P O V O W P D N V A P O W R O V O E #POS

{
from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
#POS P D N P D N R P D N P D N R V D N P O W #POS

{
But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty:
#POS F P D B X V N P V R R V P B P D N W #POS
}
{
So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
#POS P B V P D A N W F V R D S N W #POS
}
{
And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face.
#POS F D N V W V O V P D A N W F V O R V D N W #POS
}
{
So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
#POS P B V F V P B W F V B P B W #POS

{
my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.

}
{
To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight,
#POS N D N V P O V V B P D N W #POS

{
And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said,
#POS F B V P D N P D N W F V O W F V D N W F B V W #POS
}
{
And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
#POS F D N V P B W V R W O V V D N W V R W V D A N B R W #POS
}
{
and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of GOD, to know all things that are in the earth.
#POS F D N V A W V P D N P D N P B W P V D N P V P D N W #POS
}
{
To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing:
#POS P V P D N P N V D N B V D N W #POS
}
{
for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:
#POS P D N B W O V O W F O V D D N P D N P A N W #POS
}
{
As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken:
#POS P D N N W D N D N W N V V P D A N F P D N P V P D N D N V V W #POS
}
{
And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said,
#POS F D N V W V R D N P B P D P D O W F D N V F V W #POS
}
{
Let my lord the king now speak.
#POS V D N D N R V W #POS
}
{
Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said,
#POS R D N V F V P D N W V R P O W O V D W D N P O V V D W F D N V W #POS
}
{
for as an angel of GOD, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy GOD will be with thee.
#POS P P D N P B W P V D N D N P V A F A W R D B D B V V P D W #POS
}
{
Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable:
#POS R A N V W D N P D N D N V R V A W #POS
}
{
to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of GOD.
#POS P V D N P P D N P D N P V V O F D N R P P D N P B W #POS
}
{
For the king will hear,
#POS P D N V V W #POS

{
and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
#POS F D B V W O V R V P D N W O V V P D N V V D N P D N W #POS
}
{
Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid:
#POS R R P O V V P V P D N P D N D N W O V P D N V V O A W #POS
}
{
neither doth GOD respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
#POS D V B V D N W R V O V V W P D V V R V P O W #POS

{
For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again;
#POS P O V V V W F V P N V P D N W D V V V T R W #POS

{
for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.
#POS P D N V V D N P K O V A W P O D N V R V N R D V W #POS
}
{
And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of GOD?
#POS F D N V W B R V O V A D N P D N P B W #POS
}
{
Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

}
{
As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.

{
that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said,
#POS P O V R V D N P N P V D A W P O V D N W F O V W #POS
}
{
Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy GOD,
#POS R V O W O V D W V D N V D B D B W #POS

{
And the king said, Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
#POS F D N V W O V V P D W V O P O W F O V R V D D A W #POS
}
{
and the king and his throne be guiltless.
#POS F D N F D N V A W #POS
}
{
And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house:
#POS F D N P B V P D N W D N W B B W D N V P O W F P D S N W #POS
}
{
And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.

}
{
and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder unto the earth.

for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the hier also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left,
#POS P D N P D N P O N W F O V V D N R W F P O V V D N O V A W #POS

{
And behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him,
#POS F V W D A N V V P A N W F O V W V O P V D N W P O V V O W #POS

{
but the one smote the other, and slew him.
#POS F D K V D A W F N O W #POS

{
And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them,
#POS F D B V K N W F O K V R P D N W F R V N P V O W #POS
}
{
And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.
#POS F D N V P O W O V D W F O V W O V R D N N W F O N V A W #POS
}
{
And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
#POS F R D N P B V P D N W O V P D N P D N W F V N W F V W V W B B W #POS

{
And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
#POS F V P D N W F V P D N P O W P B V D N P D N W #POS
}
{
and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:

{
And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner,

{
Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.

{
And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
#POS F D N P B B V P V R P B W P O V V V B W V O V A W #POS

{
So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.

{
But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.

{
and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.

And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold, the king's sons came, lifted up their voice and wept:

and behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.

But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked,

{
Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.

Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead:

And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said,

Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon;
#POS R B V V D N W V W B O R R Z N V A P N W F R O V P O W V B W #POS

{
But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
#POS F B V O W P O V B F D D S N V P O W #POS

{
Then said Absalom, if not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?

And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.

And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, Lest we be chargeable unto thee.

{
and his servants go with thy servant.

and Absalom invited all the king's sons.

And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim:
#POS F O V P V P K A N W O B V N P B W O V P B W #POS
}
{
And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
#POS F B V P D N V D A F A W P B V B W P O V V D N B W #POS
}
{
But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
#POS F R B B V P X D N W O V R A W #POS

{
regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
#POS V R D N W P B V A P D N Z N W #POS

{
And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother;
#POS F V D N V P O W V B D N V P D W F V R D N W D N W O V D N W #POS
}
{
And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
#POS F B V N P D N W F V D N P N N P V P O W F V D N P D N W F V P V W #POS

{
Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
#POS R D N V O T W F V D N P O W #POS

{
And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled.
#POS F O V D N P N N P O W P P A N V D S N P V N N W #POS

{
Then he called his servants that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
#POS R O V D N P V P O W F V W V R D N P P O W F V D N P O W #POS
}
{
But he would not hearken unto her.
#POS F O V R V P O W #POS

{
And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me.
#POS F O V P O W X V D N W D A P V O R V A P D A P O V P O W #POS
}
{
And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.
#POS F B V P O W V W V V W #POS

{
Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her.
#POS R B V O R W P P D N V O V O V A P D N V O V V O W #POS
}
{
Howbeit, he would not hearken unto her voice: but being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
#POS C W O V R V P D N W F V A P O W V O W F V P O W #POS

{
Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.

And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.

{
And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.
#POS F R O V V O P O P V W O V V P O W F V P O W V V P O W D N W #POS
}
{
And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
#POS F B V D N D O V V W F V O P D N P V D N W #POS

{
And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand.
#POS F B V P B W V D N P D N W P O V V P D N W #POS

{
Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.
#POS V T D N P O W F O V T D N P O W #POS

And she took a pan, and poured them out before him: but he refused to eat. And Amnon said,
#POS F O V D N W F V O T P O W F O V P V W F B V W #POS
}
{
And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in hai sight, and did bake the cakes.
#POS F O V N W F V O W F V N P D N W F V V D N W #POS

{
So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down.

Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.

{
let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.
#POS V B D N V W F V O D N P N P D N W P O V V P D N W #POS

{
So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee,
#POS P B V T W F V O A W F R D N V V P V O W B V P D N W O V D W #POS
}
{
I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.

{
And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him,
#POS F B V P O W V D R P D N W F V O A W F R D N V P V D W V P O W #POS
}
{
And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
#POS F B V P O W O V B W D N Z N W #POS

{
And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me?
#POS F O V P O W R N O W V D S N W V P N P N W V O R V O W #POS
}
{
But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man.
#POS F B V D N W L N V B W D N P B Z N W F B V D R A N W #POS

{
and Amnon though it hard for him to do any thing to her.
#POS F B P O A P O P V D N P O W #POS
}
{
And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin;
#POS F B V R A W P O V A P D N B W P O V D A W #POS
}
{
And it came to pass after this Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
#POS F O V P V P O P D N P B V D A N W L N V B W F B D N P B V O W #POS
}
{
So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
#POS P B F D D N V P B W #POS
}
{
and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and this did he unto all the cites of the children of Ammon.
#POS F V O V P D N W F O V O P D D N P D N P B W #POS
}
{
And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron,
#POS F O V V D N P V N W F V O P N F P N P N W F P N P N W #POS
}
{
and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
#POS F O V V P Z N W F O V V D N P D N P A N W #POS
}
{
And he took their king's crown from off his head, (the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones,)
#POS F O V D S N P P D N W W D N R V D N P B P D A N W W #POS
}
{
And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
#POS F B V X D N R W F V P B W F V P O W F V O W #POS
}
{
and it be called after my name.
#POS F O V V P D N W #POS

{
Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city. and take it: lest I take the city,
#POS R R V D N P D N R W F V P D N W F V O W P O V D N W #POS
}
{
And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
#POS F B V N P B W F V W O V V P B W F V V D N P N W #POS
}
{
And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
#POS F B V P B P D N P B W F V D A N W #POS
}
{
And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
#POS F O V P D N P B D N W F O V D N B W P P D N W #POS
}
{
and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.
#POS F O V D N B W F D B V O W #POS
}
{
And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and he bare a son,
#POS F B V N D N W F V P P O W F V P O W F O V D N W #POS
}
{
But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
#POS F R O V A W N V O A W V O V O R R W O V V P O W F O V R V P O W #POS
}
{
for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
#POS P O V W O V V P B V V A P O W P D N V V W #POS
}
{
And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted, and wept:
#POS F O V W P D N V R A W O V W F V W #POS
}
{
but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
#POS F R D N V A W O V V F V N W #POS
}
{
Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive;
#POS R V D N P O W O N V O P O V V W O R A F V P D N P O V A W #POS
}
{
and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
#POS F V W R O V P D A N W F R O V W O V N P O W F O V V W #POS
}
{
Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD,
#POS R B V P D N W F V W F V O W F V D N W F V P D N P D B W #POS
}
{
therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, He is dead.
#POS R B V P D N W V D N A W F O V W O V A W #POS
}
{
But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead:
#POS F R B V P D N V W B V P D N V A W #POS
}
{
how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?
#POS R V O R V O W P O V O P D N V A W #POS
}
{
for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice:
#POS P O V W V W P D N V R A W O V P O W F O V R V P D N W #POS
}
{
And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead:
#POS F O V P V P D A N W P D N V W F D N P B V P V O P D N V A W #POS
}
{
And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
#POS F D N P D N V W F V P O W P V O T P D N W F O V R W O V O V N P O W #POS
}
{
David therefore besought GOD for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
#POS B R B B P D N W F B A W F V P W F V D N P D N W #POS
}
{
And Nathan departed into his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
#POS F B V P D N W F D B V D N P Z N A P B W F O V R A W #POS
}
{
the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.
#POS D N R O V V P D V R V W #POS

{
Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme,
#POS C W P P D N O V V A N P D N P D B P V W #POS
}
{
The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
#POS D N R V V R D N W O V R V W #POS

{
And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David,
#POS F B V P B W O V V P D N W F B V P B W #POS
}
{
For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
#POS P O V O R W F O V V D N P D B W F P D N W #POS

{
and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.

Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes,
#POS R V D B W V W O V V T A P D P P D A N W F O V V D N P D N W #POS

{
because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
#POS P O V V O W F V V D N P B D B P V D N W #POS
}
{
Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
#POS R R D N V R V P A N W #POS

{
and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
#POS F V V D N P V D N W F V V O P D N P D N P B W #POS
}
{
Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword,
#POS B V O V D N P D B W P V A P D N W O V V B D B P D N W #POS
}
{
and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.
#POS F P O V V R A W O V R V V P D A F A N W #POS

{
And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah;

{
Thus saith the LORD GOD of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
#POS R V D B B P B W O V D N P B W F O V D P P D N P B W #POS
}
{
And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man.
#POS F B V P B W D N D N W #POS

{
And he shall restore the lamb four-fold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
#POS F O V V D N A W P O V D N W F P O V D N W #POS

{
and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die.
#POS F O V P B W P D B B W D N P V V D N V R V W #POS

{
And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man;
#POS F Z N V R V P D N W #POS

{
to dress for the way-faring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
#POS P V P D N N P V V P O W F V D A S N W F V O P D N P V V P O W #POS

And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd,
#POS F R V D N P D A N W F O V P V P D A N F P D A N W #POS

{
it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.

{
and it grew up together with him, and with his children;
#POS F O V T R P O W F P D N W #POS

But the poor man had nothing save one little ewe-lamb, which he had bought and nourished up:

{
The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:

{
There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.

And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him,

But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son.

And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.

make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.

Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another:

Then David said unto the messengers, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab,

And the messengers said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field,

So the messengers went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.

why went ye nigh the wall? The say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

Who smote Ahimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall that he died in Thebez?

Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;

And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab:

And he wrote in the letter, saying,

And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk:
