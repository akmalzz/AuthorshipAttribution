I think what I'm trying to convey is people need to stop reinforcing that girls are controllable and weak humans who can be abused.

If you keep that up, in the end, you'll only result in showing you're weak and could be pushed down. I ain't having that.

That is why I believe females need to learn how to be strong-willed, independent, and learn how to fucking lay their foot down on matters.
#POS O V R O V N V P V R P V A W A W F V R P V V D N R P N W #POS

#POS P O V L A W L V P V O W L V L N W A W F V P D N W #POS

To be honest, if you let people know you are scared or fearful - the people who seek girls who are weak or pushovers will try to find them.
